# ExpenseTracker
There are 3 different projects in the solution:
- ExpenseTracker.Api: contains the controller with the endpoints for the API
- ExpenseTracker.Client: contains the UI
- ExpenseTracker.Domain: contains the business logic

In order to get the solution running, both the ExpenseTracker.Api and the ExpenseTraker.Client projects need to be started. The client is made usin Blazor and the Api is configured to use InMemory database just for simplicity
